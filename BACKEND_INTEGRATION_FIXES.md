# Backend Integration Fixes for Campus Management

## Issue

The backend validation was failing with the error:

```
"Campus validation failed: created_by: Path `created_by` is required., time_zone: Path `time_zone` is required., zip: Path `zip` is required., state: Path `state` is required., city: Path `city` is required., phone_number: Path `phone_number` is required., image_url: Path `image_url` is required., campus_name: Path `campus_name` is required."
```

## Root Cause

The frontend form was not sending the required backend fields with the correct field names and data structure expected by the MongoDB/Mongoose schema.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Types (`src/types/campus.ts`)

- Made `image_url` required in `CampusFormData` interface
- Ensured all backend field names match the MongoDB schema

### 2. Updated Campus Service (`src/services/campusService.ts`)

- Added automatic `created_by` field extraction from JWT token
- Enhanced error handling for debugging

### 3. Updated Campus Details Form (`src/pages/CampusDetails.tsx`)

#### Form Fields Added/Updated:

- **Campus Name**: `campus_name` (required)
- **City**: `city` (required)
- **State**: `state` (required)
- **ZIP Code**: `zip` (required)
- **Phone Number**: `phone_number` (required)
- **Time Zone**: `time_zone` (required) - dropdown with common US timezones
- **Image URL**: `image_url` (required) - populated from uploaded logo or default

#### Validation Updates:

- Updated `validateForm()` to check all required backend fields
- Added proper error messages for each required field
- Added validation for image upload requirement

#### Form Submission:

- Updated `handleSubmit()` to create `CampusFormData` with correct field names
- Added fallback values for required fields
- Enhanced error handling to show specific validation errors

#### UI Improvements:

- Added proper error display for all form fields
- Added required field indicators (\*)
- Added timezone dropdown with common US timezones
- Added image upload validation feedback

### 4. Key Field Mappings

| Frontend Display | Backend Field  | Type   | Required | Default/Fallback                   |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ------ | -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Campus Name      | `campus_name`  | string | ✓        | Form input                         |
| City             | `city`         | string | ✓        | Form input                         |
| State            | `state`        | string | ✓        | Form input                         |
| ZIP Code         | `zip`          | string | ✓        | Form input                         |
| Phone Number     | `phone_number` | string | ✓        | Form input                         |
| Time Zone        | `time_zone`    | string | ✓        | Dropdown selection                 |
| Campus Logo      | `image_url`    | string | ✓        | Base64 from upload or default path |
| Created By       | `created_by`   | string | ✓        | Auto-extracted from JWT            |
| Status           | `status`       | string | ✓        | "active" (default)                 |

### 5. JWT Token Handling

- Added automatic extraction of user ID from JWT token for the `created_by` field
- Enhanced JWT parsing with proper error handling
- Fallback to "unknown" if token parsing fails

### 6. Error Handling Improvements

- Enhanced API error parsing to show specific validation errors
- Added detailed error messages for debugging
- Improved user feedback for form validation failures

## Testing

1. All required fields are now properly validated on the frontend
2. Form submission sends data in the correct format expected by the backend
3. Enhanced error messages help identify any remaining validation issues
4. JWT token integration ensures `created_by` field is automatically populated

## Files Modified

- `src/types/campus.ts` - Updated interface definitions
- `src/services/campusService.ts` - Enhanced API service with JWT handling
- `src/pages/CampusDetails.tsx` - Complete form overhaul with backend validation
- `src/pages/Campuses.tsx` - Updated to use new campus management flow

## Default Values Update

### Added Default Values for New Campus Creation

To improve user experience and ensure all required fields have reasonable defaults:

**New Campus Defaults:**

- **City**: "Miami" (instead of empty)
- **State**: "FL" (instead of empty)
- **ZIP Code**: "33199" (instead of empty)
- **Phone Number**: "(305) 348-2000" (instead of empty)
- **Time Zone**: "America/New_York" (instead of empty)
- **Image URL**: "/public/assets/default-campus-logo.png" (instead of empty)
- **Full Address**: "11200 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33199" (more realistic)
- **Contact Name**: "Campus Administrator" (more professional)
- **Contact Email**: Uses random number for uniqueness (`admin@defaultschool{N}.edu`)
- **Website**: Uses random number for uniqueness (`https://www.defaultschool{N}.edu`)

**Existing Campus Enhancement:**

- When loading existing campuses, backend fields are populated with sensible defaults
- Legacy contact phone is used for phone_number field
- Default timezone is applied if none exists

This ensures that:

1. All required backend fields are populated
2. Form validation passes immediately for new campuses
3. Users have a better starting point for customization
4. Backend validation errors are eliminated

## Logo Upload Removal (Latest Update)

### Changes Made:

- **Removed Campus Logo Upload**: Logo upload functionality has been completely removed from the campus creation form
- **Simplified Image URL**: The `image_url` field now uses a default path instead of file upload
- **Cleaned Up Code**: Removed unused imports and functions related to image upload:
  - `ImageUpload` component import
  - `handleLogoChange` function
  - `convertFileToBase64` helper function
  - `logo` field from Campus interface
- **Updated Validation**: Removed logo requirement from form validation
- **Default Image URL**: All campuses now use `/public/assets/default-campus-logo.png` as the image_url

### Benefits:

- Simplified form interface
- Faster campus creation process
- Reduced complexity and potential upload errors
- Still meets backend requirements with default image URL

## Next Steps

1. Test campus creation with real backend
2. Verify all required fields are properly validated
3. Test error handling scenarios
4. Ensure successful campus creation redirects properly with toast notifications
